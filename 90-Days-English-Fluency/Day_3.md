This video from English with Lucy addresses a common problem among English learners: understanding the language but struggling to speak it fluently (0:05). Lucy explains that this often happens because students focus more on receptive skills like listening and reading, rather than productive skills like speaking (2:07). She then provides six practical tips to improve spoken English fluency and confidence:

Talk to yourself (3:42): Narrate your day aloud or in your head (4:32). This is a free and accessible way to increase your English output and practice forming sounds (4:44). You can supercharge your vocabulary by noting down words you don't know and reviewing them later (5:08).
Talk to a tutor (7:03): Tutors offer a safe space for practice, provide accurate corrections, and can give targeted feedback (7:16). Lucy recommends LanguaTalk, a platform with a strict screening process for tutors, offering free trial sessions and a $10 lesson credit (9:16).
Write before speaking (11:03): Prepare what you want to say in common situations, like answering frequently asked questions (11:10). This helps build confidence and fluency (12:40).
Focus on fluency, not perfection (14:07): Embrace making mistakes as a learning opportunity (14:18). The goal is to be understood, not to be a "grammar genius" (14:25).
Shadowing (16:35): Copy other English speakers by repeating what you hear in videos or conversations (16:44). This improves muscle memory for forming words and natural pronunciation (17:10).
Record yourself speaking (17:55): This helps you become comfortable with the sound of your own voice and identify areas for improvement (19:15). It also serves as a benchmark to track your progress over time (19:25).
Lucy offers a free PDF with the lesson transcript, key vocabulary, and a quiz (1:06) and encourages viewers to try the LanguaTalk offer (21:14).
