Here's some vocabulary from the video relevant to C1 level English phone conversations:

Polite Inquiries about Caller Identity (2:40):

"Sorry, I didn't catch your name."
"May I ask who's calling, please?" (more formal) These phrases are used when you don't recognize the caller and want to politely ask for their name without sounding rude.
"Let me + verb" structure (3:17):

"Let me know how it goes."
"Let me check."
"Let me get back to you." This common structure is used to offer assistance or indicate an action you will take.
Replacing "zero" with "o" when giving numbers (3:51):

Example: "0344" becomes "o three four four" This is a common practice in the UK when stating phone numbers or other numerical sequences.
Using "double" for repeated numbers (4:04):

Example: "double three" for "33" This is another common practice to make numbers clearer over the phone.

"Chat soon." This is a colloquial way to say "let's talk again soon," typically used with close friends or family.
Introducing yourself on the phone (6:28):

Phrases for not understanding something (7:46):

"Sorry, I didn't quite catch that."
"Sorry, can you speak more slowly?"
"Would you mind saying that again please?" These are polite ways to ask for clarification when you haven't understood what was said.
